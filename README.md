## Juicin'

Juice Up.
Lift Heavy.
Get Huge.


## How To Play

Keep your cool and avoid the other gym goers while lifting as many weights as you can.

Use juice to increase your gains! Be careful though, you'll also have less patience should you bump into anyone.

If you get too upset, drink some water to cool off.

### Cool, but how do I run this?

To run on actual hardware, you'll need a developer cartridge such as the EverDrive 64 or 64Drive.

The game requires EEPROM4k enabled. EverDrive cartridges should automatically detect this based on the binary header. If it does not, you can edit the save_db.txt file to enable it. For the 64Drive, you'll need to enable it yourself via the menu I believe.

For emulation, you'll need a low level emulator such as CEN64. Don't forget to specify EEPROM4k. Even on recent computers, low level emulation is still typically slower than playing on real hardware.


### Technical Difficulties

If you get a blue screen that says EEPROM ERROR, you need to double check you've got your emulator / cartridge setup for EEPROM4k save files.

If you're encountering other game breaking errors, please file an issue describing it.
